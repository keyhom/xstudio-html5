# [XStudio Lite]

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.

## Documentation

Take a look at the [documentation table of contents](doc/TOC.md). This
documentation is bundled with the project, which makes it readily available for
offline reading and provides a useful starting point for any documentation you
want to write about your project.
